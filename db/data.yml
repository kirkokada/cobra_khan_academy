    - JT Torres continues this week with a De La Riva setup to sit up guard. Sometime
      when you pass off the hand, your opponent like to rip their arm away. This creates
      the perfect opportunity for you to execute this technique. The key to the sit
      up guard is to make sure your opponent can't step their foot outside and you
      need to keep it secure until the technique is fully executed.

    - "875+ BJJ Tech Demos - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/875+-bjj-technique-demos/id863770966?ls=1&mt=8\n\nPLEASE
      SUBSCRIBE! - Read Below for More Info:\n\nIn July 2006 when I was a Blue Belt
      in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu I made a video on my favorite closed guard positions
      and attacks at the time.  It was in response to a question asked in the Atama
      forum at MMA.tv. Since then it has received almost 470,000 views and I have
      received countless amounts of messages from people telling me how it has helped
      them in their game.  It was honestly never expected. I am now a Black Belt in
      BJJ and still use these techniques plus more.  I appreciate everyone's support
      and thank everyone for watching my videos as well.  I really do hope they help
      you. \n\nThis video is a recreation of that video I made in 2006 with more options
      that I use for closed guard, better video quality, no music, and voice over
      as well.  I hope this video like the last can be of help to many Grapplers.\n\nPlease
      ask questions, and post comments.  If there is something you don't understand
      then post a comment or message me about it and you never know I may make another
      video breaking down the technique or position in verbal and visual detail in
      another video for you.  Please visit my websites below:\n\nBJJ System Outline

    - The guard is a ground grappling position where one combatant has their back
      to the ground, while attempting to control the other combatant using the legs.
      In pure grappling combat sports, the guard is considered an advantageous position,
      because the bottom combatant can attack with various joint locks and chokeholds,
      while the top combatant's priority is to transition into a more dominant position,
      a process known as passing the guard.

    - The mount, or mounted position, is a dominant ground grappling position, where
      one combatant sits on the other combatants torso with the face pointing towards
      the opponent's head. This is very favourable for the top combatant in several
      ways. The top combatant can generate considerable momentum for strikes such
      as punches or elbows to the head of the opponent, while the bottom combatant
      is restricted by the ground and by the combatant on top. Another advantage are
      various chokeholds and joint locks which can be applied from the top, while
      such holds are not feasible from the bottom. The top priority for the bottom
      combatant is to sweep the opponent or transition into a better position such
      as the guard.

    - Back mount, or rear mount, is a dominant grappling position where the practitioner
      is behind his opponent in such a way that he has control of his opponent. Ideally,
      the opponent will be recumbent (prone), while the practitioner centers his weight
      atop the opponent, either in a seated or recumbent posture. Many consider back
      mount to be a very dominant, perhaps even the most advantageous position in
      grappling. This is due to the practitioner being able to attack with strikes
      and submissions with the opponent having a severely limited ability to see incoming
      attacks and defend against them.

    - Half guard, or alternatively half mount, is a ground grappling position where
      one combatant is lying on the other, with the bottom combatant having one leg
      entangled. Sometimes the bottom combatant is said to be in half guard, while
      the top combatant is in a half mount respectively. In wrestling and catch wrestling
      half mount is called Turk ride. The half guard is the position that is in between
      a full guard and side control or full mount. The combatant on top will try to
      untangle the leg and obtain side control or mount, while the bottom combatant
      will try to transition into a full guard or alternatively attempt a sweep or
      submission. The combatant on top is however in a better position, and can strike
      or attempt submission holds, although not as well as in side control.

    - The De la Riva guard (also called the De la Riva hook and jello guard) is an
      open guard that was popularized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu by black belt Ricardo
      de la Riva Goded, who was successful with it in competition. In it, one of the
      legs is wrapped behind the opponent's leg from the outside, the ankle held with
      one hand, and the other hand grips one of their sleeves. The De la Riva guard
      offers many sweeps, transitions and submissions, and is often used in combination
      with spider guard.

    - Knee-on-stomach, or knee-on-belly, knee-on-chest, knee-ride, knee mount (uki-gatame,
      "floating hold" in budō), is a dominant ground grappling position where the
      top combatant places a knee on the bottom combatant's torso, and usually extends
      the other leg to the side for balance. This position is typically obtained from
      side control, simply by rising up slightly and putting a knee on the opponent's
      stomach or chest.
